Simulating Headlight Lighting Distributions in Automated Vehicles using Virtual Reality in Unreal Engine 5

This repository contains the simulation code for a project exploring the 
impact of different headlight distributions that imitate HD Matrix headlights in a virtual reality (VR) driving environment.

## 📌 Overview

- **Goal**: To evaluate how different high-beam and low-beam headlight configurations affect passenger comfort, safety perception, and well-being in various environments.
- **Method**: Participants experienced automated driving in VR with four lighting configurations across environments like forest, rural roads, fog, and city.
- **Tech Stack**: Unreal Engine (simulation), Python/R (analysis), VR headset.
